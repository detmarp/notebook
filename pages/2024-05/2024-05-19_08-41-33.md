#Camping #henrycoe #2024
We did a one night camp out at Henry 2500 feet above Morgan Hill.
I drove up on Friday afternoon and Catherine brought up her van. It was open, not a lot of trees. We were near the bathrooms, but we still had a really good time. They said we had one more week until fire pits due to fire season.
Are extensive trails up there in the hills we did a little 2 1/2 walk.
