I just got out of this movie. Emma Stone, Willem dafoe. Mark ruffalo. This was amazing. It was so original, visually and the story. The acting with Willem Dafoe and Emma Stone was almost perfect. But they put Mark ruffalo's character through. Had me laughing out loud so much. It had elements of being John malkovich and Eraserhead. I love the originality. Emma Stone was just amazing, just a flawless character,. Visually almost every frame seem to original, like nothing else I'd seen in the movies. I think the story may be ran out of steam in the last 20 minutes or so, but I enjoyed everything about it.
