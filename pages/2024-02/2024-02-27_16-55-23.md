We walked along the dirt path from the sunset-lit summit back into the redwoods. Off to our right, down a slope, temporarily thickly green from the winter rain, two deer stepped carefully toward the tree line. We looked over our shoulders at them and laughed, surprised to see them so close, and so perfectly at home. And they looked over their shoulders back at us, their eyes laughing at these two loud momentary visitors.
