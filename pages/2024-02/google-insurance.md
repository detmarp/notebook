I'm reminded that Google health insurance is self-funded.  Anthem administers the program, but Google funds the insurance payments.

IncludedHealth aka Health+ is "is the central support hub for all of your healthcare needs" which is a service that I get through my Anthem enrollment. Ah right, IncludedHealth is the 800 number on the back of my Anthem card: 855.431.5540
