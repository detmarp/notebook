#Botox #health.
Got my usual Botox treatment today. This last session these last 3 months were fairly good. Actually the best eye control ever. That's because last time we up the dosage around my eye. Today we increase the dosage slightly around my temple. The hope there is that we can get the control to last a few weeks longer. This last time these last 3 weeks have been pretty ticky.
One more thing, next time we are going to try a little shot up in the forehead over my left eyebrow, with the hope that it will lower my left eyebrow a little because I tend to be a little asymmetric.
